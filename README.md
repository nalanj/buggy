# ðŸ›’ Buggy

- buggy serve starts a web server for you
- buggy queue starts a queue for you
- buggy run runs commands from the cli for you

Stuff to do:

- Invalid args error, sends back 422
- Get serve working in some meaningful way
- Set up config loading for top-level config
- Score perfect on observatory by default with https
